# Caverns of Titan

![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built_with-rust-orange?logo=rust)

This is an exploration game written entirely in Rust, a former game jam project turned hobby project. The game has a small scope due to the circumsatances it was designed in. Due to personal issues however, the project was never finished past some basic mechanics. This started in C++, but since I've been learning Rust, I chose to re-write everything here as a nice challenge to myself.

The project takes place deep in the icy depths of Titan, one of Saturn's many moons. Your goal as a lost explorer, one who can barely communicate with the world, is to survive the horrors that may reside within while you collect the tools to escape.

## Contributing?

It's awesome that you want to contribute! Since this is just a small project, without any massive time investment into configuration and CD/CI shenanigans, I don't have any real *design standards* or rules when it comes to contributing. Keep your Rust in `snake_case` and don't overengineer everything, please!

## Python?

Yes, Python. Only a bit though. I use it to make simple tools because I don't want to do some things by hand, I would probably go insane after a while. For GUI apps I use `[pygame-ce](https://pyga.me)` since I already know it and learning something else would be bleh. All the tools besides their pygame requirement are entirely singlefile so you can run them on any verison of Python 3 and above.
